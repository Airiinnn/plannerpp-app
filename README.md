## What is **Planner++**?
**Planner++** is a personal project aimed at creating a streamlined planner app for personal school use, as well as 
gaining experience with Full-Stack Web Application Development, primarily using **React & Redux** for the Front End,
**Scala & Play** for the Back End and **MongoDB** for the Database.

**Planner++** is heavily inspired by the **Kanban framework** on Jira and task organization features from Notion. It 
builds upon my current task organization system on Notion, removing redundant features and simplifying the overall task 
management workflow.
